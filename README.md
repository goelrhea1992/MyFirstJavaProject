# MyFirstJavaProject

For my first Java project, back in 2011, I created an interactive map of the Delhi metro.

The idea was to learn multi-threaded programming and GUI building, along with mastering basic Java data structures.

The map displays different metro lines (distinguished by color) and pops up information about a station upon mouse hover. The user can add a train on any line, and they'de see the train moving on the line! One could add as many trains as they'd like.

It was a great, fun way of learning Java!
